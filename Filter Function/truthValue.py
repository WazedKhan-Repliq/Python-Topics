"""
Note: Python follows a set of rules to determine an objectâ€™s truth value.

For example, the following objects are falsy:

1. Constants like None and False
2. Numeric types with a zero value, like 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), and Fraction(0, 1)
3. Empty sequences and collections, like "", (), [], {}, set(), and range(0)
4. Objects that implement __bool__() with a return value of False or __len__() with a return value of 0

Any other object will be considered truthy.

print(list(filter(None, objects)))

# filter() tests every item in the input iterable using the Python rules you saw before.
# Then it yields those items that evaluate to True.
