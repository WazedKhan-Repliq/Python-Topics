"""
Itertools.count()
itertools.count() are generally used with map() to generate consecutive data points which is useful in
when working with data. It can also be used with zip to add sequences by passing count as parameter.
Parameters:
start: Start of the sequence (defaults to 0)
step: Difference between consecutive numbers (defaults to 1)

Returns: Returns a count object whose .__next__() method returns consecutive values.

Example #2: Emulating enumerate() using itertools.count()
As mentioned earlier, count() can be used with zip().
Letâ€™s see how can we use it to mimic the functionality of enumerate() without even knowing the length of list beforehand!
